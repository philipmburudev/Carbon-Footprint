In 2020, 7.5 billion metric tons (International Energy Agency, 2021) of carbon dioxide, emitted through different modern modes of transportation, accounted for about 16.2% of the total global carbon emissions (34 billion metric tons) (Le Quéré et al., 2020). Undoubtedly, the rise in global temperatures can be attributed to the combustion of fossil fuels from the frequent use of cars, buses, airplanes, and ships that release greenhouse gasses into the atmosphere. It is then essential to focus on mitigation strategies to reduce the impact of transportation on climate change. 

We must highlight the need to implement sustainable practices into our daily lives which, in this instance, involves shifting to more sustainable modes of transportation like walking or biking, or by improving transportation efficiency by reducing traffic congestion. In charting our path towards sustainable living, using carbon footprint would play a pivotal role in raising awareness on the impact of these emissions. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (2014), carbon footprint is the measure or calculation of how much carbon is produced by human actions such as driving, eating, or in production. In an attempt to mitigate climate change, we plan to build a program that uses carbon footprint to track how human modes of transportation produce carbon dioxide and methane. 

The program prompts the user to input their starting and destination locations, as well as their intended mode of transportation. Based on this information, the program calculates the actual emissions produced by the distance traveled. Then, using a level-based classification system, the program identifies the mode of transportation that generates the least amount of emissions and recommends the shortest route to the user to further minimize emissions.  
 
The program is designed to allow the user to repeat this process as many times as needed. Each time the user enters new locations, the program logs the actual emissions produced and the recommended emissions for that trip, and adds them to a list. The program then compares the total actual emissions to the total recommended emissions, providing the user with an estimate of the environmental impact of their travel choices. To accomplish this, the program leverages a range of object-oriented programming concepts, including input/output operations, data structures, and conditional statements.
