The program starts with a walm welcome then gives the user a debrief of what it is about. Next, it prompts the user to enter their starting and destination locations, as well as their intended mode of transportation. Based on this information, the program calculates the actual emissions produced by mode of tranport chosen according to the distance being traveled. Then, using a level-based classification system, the program identifies the mode of transportation that generates the least amount of emissions and recommends the shortest route to the user to further minimize emissions.

The program is designed to allow the user to repeat this process as many times as needed. Each time the user enters new locations, the program logs the actual emissions produced and the recommended emissions for that trip, and adds them to a list. The program then compares the total actual emissions to the total recommended emissions, providing the user with an estimate of the environmental impact of their travel choices. To accomplish this, the program leverages a range of object-oriented programming concepts, including input/output operations, data structures, and conditional statements.
